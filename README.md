# Login form

Simple login form that validates using mocked values, and presents a list of things

## How to run

First of all, setup the project

```text
git clone git@github.com:Andrewmat/login-form.git
yarn install
```

* Run `yarn start:prod` and access http://localhost:5000
* If you want to check development mode, run `yarn start` and access http://localhost:3000
* To run the test suite, run `yarn test`

## Under the hood

This project was bootstraped from [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and ejected.

It uses mostly React hooks

It uses Prettier to ease code styling

I opted to not use Redux, since it is a simple application that did not need for a global state management library

**TODO**
